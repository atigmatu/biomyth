<p> phone calls with loved ones

  ivy covered buildings

  after a good cry

  making someone blush for
  <br>the first time

  <p>
  memorizing their phone number

  the color yellow

  <br>
throat laughs

orange of city lights

leaving flowers on doorsteps

broken in shoes

coming home after

smelling like bonfire

out of tune "happy birthday"

dancing in the rain
