<p> <a href="trust.html"> Mom got very sick when I was in about second grade, had something called cushing's
  syndrome. It has to do with the pituitary gland producing too much of the hormone
  adrenocorticotropin which results in the adrenal gland making too many corticosteroids.
  It's basically an imbalance in hormones. <br> <br>
  This imbalance fucks up a lot of things in the body, physically
  and emotionally. We didn't notice either difference at first; the physical is pretty
  obvious now going back and looking at pictures but <br>
  she was <i> mean, </i> and I don't say
  that lightly. Dad started spending more time at
  the church and my older sibling stayed out late with
  friends, did anything to stay out of the house, away from her.
  <br> <br>
  I didn't realize what exactly was going on as a second grader but
  knew something was very wrong. There was no one to
  teach me how to take care of myself, or to teach any of us for that matter.
  We were all trapped in our own
  cycles of self preservation.
