  <p> If you decide as a trans person to transition medically with the help of HRT you will most likely
    get diagnosed with an endocrine disorder, commonly called a hormone imbalance. Which is basically saying that
    your body isn't producing enough of the hormone you require and thus the need for medication
    and is sometimes used in conjuction with a diagnosis of dysphoria, something that is becoming less
    common as a diagnosis for many reasons that you can ask me about later. <br> <br>

    I'd like you to guess what kind of a disorder cushing's syndrome is. <br>
