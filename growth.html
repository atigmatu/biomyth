    <p> Dad used to teach youth soccer partly to be around us more because of the business of church and
      also in part because I think he wanted us all to be "well rounded individials", we did dance, band, and art, why
      not a more "physical" sport. </p>

      <p>
      The issue with this concept of "well roundedness" was Quinn and I never really got the point of soccer like the older four did.
      Not for lack of skill, both of us were pretty athletic kids but I had no interest in running that much and
      after years of seeing Quinn do whatever they wanted on the field I decided to follow in their stead,
